		<h1>Customer acquisition<h1>
		<h2>Top of funnel<h2>
		<p>Customer acquisition is the first step to identifying product market fit. We believe we’ve reached product market fit as we’ve identified and tested a few acquisition channels, and we’ve identified one that provides pretty good unit economics. Twitter is converting at around $9-16/sign-up.</p>
		<p><a href="ADD">CAC Analytics</a></p> <!-- 1. ADD ANALYTICS LINK -->

		<p>We've classified our customers into 2 segments</p>

		<ul>
			<li>1. Developers <br>
				We expect our developers to have an LTV of 39*12=$468.</li>

			<li>2. Enterprise <br>
				We expect an enterprise LTV of $1,000-$2,000.
				<p class = "small">Assuming 12 monthly payments.</p></li> 
		</ul>

		<p>We can acquire customers for aprox. $15-$40, or roughly one month of revenue. Not too shabby.</p>

		<p>Take a look at our rational here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-were-ditching-adwords-putting-all-our-money-social-julien-jacques?trk=mp-author-card" target="_blank">Why we're ditching AdWords</a></p><!-- 1. ADD ANALYTICS LINK -->

		<h1>Onboarding<h1>
		<h2>Middle of Funnel<h2>
		<p>Our core metric for onboarding is based on maps tracked. We currently have about 20% of all signups logging in every few days. They all have one thing in common - they've sucessfully connected their analytics snippet code to a map. Our key onboarding metric is  as there's a clear relationship between how quickly</p> <!-- 1.

		<h1>Customer retention<h1>
		<h2>End-ish part of funnel<h2>
		<p>This is still unchartered territory for us as we've only just recently launched. However, our beta period that ran for almost a year, shows that there were engaged enterprise type clients month over month. So, we are confident that we're adding valuable insights and data to web map developers.</p>
		<p>I read this recently - it's something the CEO of HBO said, "We're in the business of creating addicts". This wrung so true to me. It's a great way to think of your business. If you're sole goal is to maximize revenue today, you end up being blinded by what really matters - adding more value to your customers than you extract. That's prbably another stolen quote. But it's true.</p>

		<p>Building a product that people actually use, is incredibly difficult. Especially when you're in the SaaS business. We know this, because pretty much everyone on our team has tried to do this before. </p>

		<p>But we can see engaged users. Very engaged users, who are coming back frequently and are seeing value in the tool. That's what actually matters. "Focus on the product".</p>

		<h3>The Making Money Part</h3>
		<p>We're still solving for this. After speaking to gis web developers, analysts etc., we belieive that developers would pay $39/month and our pricing structure for Enterprise is $99/month + additional $ per map loads after 100,000 map loads.</p>

		<h2>What we need to test in the short term</h2>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Users aren't adding their Credit Card<br>
				We'll be A/B testing different customer journey funnels to see which is the most appropriate place to ask for their Credit Card information. Will be testing, putting it up as the 2nd page when you sign-up.'</li>
				<br>
			<li>Revenue<br>
				We've already set in a place a pricing strategy of Freemium with gated features, to atleast see if users engage with the platform. However, we don't have a clear path to payment. Currently we sign-up free plans, and have 2-3 enterprise demos a week.</li> 
				<br>
			<li>Customer Pain Points<br>
				Many enterprise clients are looking for more web map integrations including ESRI, Mapbox and CartoDB. Tapping into these mapping platforms will drive more users and we hope paid clients, as many of these users are accustomed to paying for gis software.</li> 
		</ul>
		</ul>

		<h1>Growth<h1>
		<h2>Bottom of funnel<h2>
		<p>This is still unchartered territory for us as we've only just recently launched. However, our beta period that ran for almost a year, shows that there were engaged enterprise sty;e clients month over month. So, we are confident that we're adding valuable insights and data to web map developers.</p>

		<p>Growth is only sustainable if you focus on unit economics. A large LTV and a small CAC == great unit economics. Our focus at the moment is to test and optimize for great unit economics. In other words, we are still testing an effective pricing strategy and trying to identify rela customer pain points, to make our product better</p>

		<p>Once we comfortable with pricing, and our sales funnel strategy, we will apply growth strategies</p>


		<h2>What we've accomplished so far<h2>
			<ul>
				<li>PR: We've launched and received PR on a podcast, techvibes and multiple GIS specific blogs and publications</li>
				<li>Built a small community: We've built a small community of 600+ geospatial enthusiasts througha Slack team. This has helped us tremendeously with engaging with our audience.</li>
				<li>Customer Acquisition Channels: We've identified some acquisition channels that actually move the needle in terms of sign ups.</li>
		
			</ul>
